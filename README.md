# Sequence Counter

## Brief

My implementation uses a graph, alongside a recusive depth-first-search to find all possible valid sequences within a given numberpad.

Lightweight unit tests have been used during implementation to validate my work.

## Run the program

From project root:

```bash
python src/solution.py
```

## Run the tests

From project root:
```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_solution -v 
```
